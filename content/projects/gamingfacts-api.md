## Introduction

A simple api that returns a random interesting fact about videogames/gaming.

I wholeheartedly believe in learning-by-doing, so this is my first step into learning Go.

## How it works

It's a simple GET request. You can test it out using:

```bash
curl https://gamingfacts.cfsilva.com/
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{ "fact": "The first game to use a game engine was 'Space Rogue' in 1989." }
```

## Tech Stack

The project was built using Go

## Github Repo
